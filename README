ElasT 1.2 (2021)
------------

ElasT is a pre/post processing package for thermoelasticity calculations,
currently only interfaced to the VASP code.

It is coded to prepare the structures, inputs and outputs for elastic calculations 
of crystals either at zero kelvin or at finite temperatures.

The package includes:
  * ./source    <source code>
  * ./lib       <blas and lapack libs>
  * ./examples  <example calculations at 0K, for finite-temperature examples see Li, Y. (2021).

    https://doi.org/10.5285/560124c7-88ad-4e31-a59e-c6cdc539d03e>

Install:
  * Modify the fortran compiler and library paths in ./source/Makefile
    If no blas and lapack library available, first go to ./lib and run ./install.sh
  * Under the source directory, type "make" 
  * Or, you can directly type: 
    "gfortran elast.f90 ssnpt.f90 dist.f90 readin.f90 
    doread.f90 extract.f90 dev.f90 calc.f90 fitting.f90 data.f90  nrtype.f90 
    dlexlib.f90 -o elast.x -fallow-argument-mismatch -O3 -L/<path to blas>/BLAS-3.6.0 -lblas 
    -L/<path to lapack>/lapack-3.6.0 -llapack -I/<path to lapack>/lapack-3.6.0/LAPACKE/include/ "
    On MacOS, type:
    "gfortran elast.f90 ssnpt.f90 dist.f90 readin.f90 doread.f90 extract.f90 dev.f90 calc.f90 
     fitting.f90 data.f90  nrtype.f90 dlexlib.f90 -o elast.x -framework Accelerate -fallow-argument-mismatch -O3"
  * copy the executable ./source/elast.x to your ~/bin
 
Features of package:
  * Isothermal elastic constants for any lattice system
  * Thermoelastic constants from molecular dynamics
  * Thermoelastic constants from constant volume ensembles (NVT, NVE, etc)
  * Thermoelastic constants from constant pressure ensembles (NPT, NPH, etc)
  * Elastic stiffnes and elastic compliance constants
  * Born mechanical stability
  * Aggregate properties (Voigt, Reuss and Hill averages)
  * Error estimates

Input and output:
  Input
  * Input file: elastic.in
  * VASP files: INCAR KPOINTS POTCAR POSCAR 
  Ouput
  * main results on screen display, stresses also in stress.out
  * stress.out: this file collects averaged stress tensors. The eiight columns from let to right are the index of 
    the degree of strain, the index of strain tensor, and the six components of stress tensors in the order of 
    XX, YY, ZZ, XY, YZ and ZX.
  * devt.dat: similar to the stress.out file, but the last six components are the standard deviations of the stress tensor.


Parameters in input file elastic.in
  * latt = 7            # lattice type: 1-7: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic,tetragonal,trigonal, hexagonal, cubic
  * nstrain = 2         # integer: number of strains to be applied;
  * delta = -0.01 0.01  # array: values of applied strains (nstrain) ;
  * md = yes            # yes: molecular dynamics calculation at finite-temperature; no: static calculation;
  * npt = yes           # yes: calculate Cij from constant-pressure MD run; no:calculate Cij from constant-volume MD run; 
  * polynmord = 2       # integer: the order of polynomial fitting, for npt this will be neglected
       
Run: 
  * prepare elastic.in POSCAR INCAR KPOINTS POTCAR
  * type elast.x
  * run vasp in each generated directory 
  * type elast.x 
  * maybe more convient to wrap the above in your job script
